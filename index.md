## Welcome to Xpp Devs
We are a community of passionate X++ developers collaborating on documenting best practices, gathering code samples and creating tools, to continously improve code quality and productivity of anyone interested.

### Why This Site Exists
The Microsoft Dynamics AX community has grown over the years, and many people have started blogs and open source projects on sites such as CodePlex. Although many useful tools have been released over the years, they all have their own pros and cons. Some are maintained and others abandoned. Some are for one version but not another. This site is born as the next evolution of that great community, we want to move past sharing, and start collaborating. We believe that focusing and bundling our efforts is the right way to move forward. 
We encourage you to browse what we have to offer, and get involved!

### What We Are Not
Although we gladly review specific requests for tooling or additional code samples, requests for help or specific questions related to X++ or Microsoft Dynamics AX should go to the Dynamics AX Community Forums, where many of us are active. 

### Get Involved
This is GitHub. We are not merely sharing our code, we actively improve and maintain that code together - and so can you!
* [Follow our discussions](/forum.html) - and join the discussion if you have something to say!
* If you're using any of our code and found an issue or see a missing feature, please make a branch and send us a pull request!
* Tell your X++ friends and colleagues about us!
* [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xppdevs)

## Where To Start?
Currently we are focusing on the following three major efforts.

### Tools
Development tools, code generators, build and deployment scripts... These go here.

### Patterns and Best Practices
Patterns and best practices, documented and with code examples... These go here.

### Code Samples and Tutorials
Code samples, tutorial code, miscellaneous code... These go here.
